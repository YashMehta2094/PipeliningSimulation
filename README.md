# PipeliningSimulation
Project Description:
This project simulates a basic scalar pipeline architecture of a CPU. It features key stages of instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory operations, and write-back. The simulation addresses pipeline hazards, incorporates branch prediction and handling, and supports memory and register operations. Key performance metrics are tracked to analyze and optimize pipeline efficiency.

Running the Simulation
Unzip the project folder.
Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
